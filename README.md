# LinkedList
*Linked List implementation*

**The Linked List is a data structure used to solve various problems, where you can add items to it from back, front, or at any index.
Also, you can remove items from it from back, front, or at any index, in addition to the ability to search for items or get the items at a certain index**

## In this project I implemented the main Linked List methods which are:
- **insertAtFirst**: Method to insert items at the first of the list.
- **insertAtLast**: Method to insert items at the end of the list.
- **insertAtIndex**: Method to insert item at a certain position in the list.
- **removeFirst**: Method removes the first item from the list.
- **removeLast**: Method removes the last item from the list.
- **removeAtIndex**: Method removes an item from the list from a certain position.
- **remove**: Method removes a certain value from the list.
- **getAtIndex**: Method returns the item value at certain index.
- **search**: Method searches for a certain item in the list if the item is not found it returns -1.
- **empty**: Method checks whether the list is empty or not.
- **getLength**: Method returns the length of the List.
- **print**: Method to print all the list items.
